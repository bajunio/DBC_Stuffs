	<h3><a href="images/reddit_frame.jpg">Site 1: Reddit</a></h3>
	<p>
		Reddit is filling a need for a very specific, user driven news feed.  With endless "subs" allowing you to reach just about any content you're looking for.  Fortunately they have kept the "flash" at a minimum to focus on their content delivery.  However, it can seem like a wall of text staring you down as you view the content.

	<h3><a href="images/google_frame.jpg">Site 2: Google</a></h3>
	<p>
		Likely the most well known site on the internet!  It provides us with access to all of the web's resources by using advanced searching methods to return our results.  Much like Reddit, the like to keep the layout simple and focus on their primary goal:  getting you to search and increase the effectiveness of their engine.

	<h3><a href="images/youtube_frame.jpg">Site 3: YouTube</a></h3>
	<p>
		Also user driven, YouTube provides an outlet for publishing your video content to the world.  I feel YouTube does have to struggle with screen real estate.  Having such focus on flashy video content can lead to saturation of the user's landing page.  I dislike how crowded my YouTube homepage is, for instance.
