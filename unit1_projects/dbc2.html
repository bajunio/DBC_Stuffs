		<h4>Hubbub on Haight</h4>
		<p>
			Earlier today, an extremely irate bearded man was observed making a scene on the corner of Haight and Ashbury. Bystanders claimed that the bearded man was clearly in a state of heightened agitation, shaking his fist while lamenting the sorry state of beards in the world today.</br> 
		</br>
			When asked to comment, one lightly-bearded witness claimed, "The bearded man was clearly out of line, but I couldn't help admiring the luster and full-bodied density of his beard." A female non-beard also remarked, "While I may have disagreed with the bearded man's approach to airing his discontent, I sure wish my boyfriend could grow a beard like that!" <span style="color:blue">The bearded man could not be reached for comment</span>.
