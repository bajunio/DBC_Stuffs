			<h2>Week 4 - Compass of Shame</h2>

				Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</br>
				</br>
				Once, while awaiting my BART train, I ran into a rather unhappy person, also waiting. As I took my place in line the individual in question sprung to his feet (he had been sitting on one of the stone benches) to confront me. It would seem that I had been standing too close to him.  He proceeded to verbally assault me for at least 45 seconds while I stood there, mouth agape.  I couldn't believe this man was losing his mind in this way.</br>
				</br>
				What was the source of the conflict?</br>
				</br>
				Since this incident, I have had the benefit of observing this individual (on two seperate occasions) initiating conflict such as this with other BART-goers. As a result, I have determined he is simply looking for confrontation.  However, at the time I was completely thrown off as to why he was so upset. Going with the facts he provided in his verbal assault, I was standing too close to him and (according to his assessment) I was trying to "make [him] gay."</br>
				</br>
				How did you handle that conflict?</br>
				</br>
				I dislike phsyical confrontation.  I grew up being the biggest kid in my peer group, and for certain people I was deemed a "trophy" of sorts.  To eleaborate, the attitude was often, "If I can fight and win against Brian it will elevate my street cred" (lol, I grew up in the smallest farming community - we did have a couple of streets though).  Fortunately my father taught me to be clever and I am typically able to diffuse heated situations.  I attempted to rationalize with this particular individual at BART and convince him that there was no issue - all of this was just a misunderstanding.</br>
				</br>
				Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</br>
				</br>
				Worse.  Much worse.  He was not interested in my assessment of the situation.  I even had assistance from another BART patron who attempted to explain that there really wasn't a situation if he would simply cease to persist in his efforts to create one.  He squared up to me and put his fists at the ready.  I laughed.</br> 
				</br>
				If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</br>
				</br>
				Nothing, honestly.  I exited that confrontation without becoming phsically engaged and I feel that I explained my stance to him well enough to suit me.  He was not in a state to be receptive to constructive conversation and I would not have been able to alter his stance in the slightest.</br>
				</br>
				What did you learn from this experience?</br>
				</br>
				No amount of prevention can fully sheild you from the badness this world has to offer.  The lesson I continue to gain from these types of interactions is that it is up to me to set the tone for my life.  Some men just want to watch the world burn...</br>
