			<h2>Week 1 - Favorite Sites</h2>
			<p>
				<h4>Identify three of your favorite websites.</h4>
				
				<h5>1. Reddit</h5>
				I really enjoy the user driven content contained on this site.  It has a challenge of displaying a great amount of text without completely overwhelming the user.  Their approach seems to pull this off as best they can.  The lack of flashy colors aides them in delivering their content without creating stress on the user's eyes.  Having sub sections allowing the user to tune the content displayed on the front page to their interests is a very sharp feature.
				
				<h5>2. Google</h5>
				Oh Google... where would we be without you?  The problem they solve is the world's desire to manipulate big data in many creative ways.  Curious what someone's driveway in the Netherlands looks like?  No problem.  Need to gather intel on your desired user base to maximize profits?  Pfft, look no further.  Google provides a window to the world and is always looking to expand the horizon.
				
				<h5>3. Youtube</h5>
				I seem to like user driven sites.  Much like Reddit, the content contained on Youtube is a mix match of original and reposted submissions.  As much as I enjoy searching for particular videos, the onslaught of random frames and colors makes me sad.  I find myself looking through the site to focus on the very specific sections that appeal to me.
