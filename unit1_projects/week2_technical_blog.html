				<p>
					Illustrated above is an example of the "Box Model." Understanding the fundamentals involved in manipulating the box model becomes priority when your goal is to properly size html elements on a webpage.
					<br> 
					There are many specific commands that come into play when positioning elements (blocks of content) within your page.  Today we will instead focus on providing a surface level understanding of what is involved in basic position of an element.  
					<br>
					As you can see from the image above, the "Element Content" is encapsilated by several frames; "padding," "border," and "margin".  These become important when determining the layout of your design.  Below I will give a brief rundown of each section of the image.  Its important to note that each of the "frames" can be adjusted by leveraging special css commands.
					<br>
					Element Content:  The very thing you're attempting to position.  This could be an image, text, or even a table.  
					<br>
					Padding:  Padding offers a small buffer between your border and your content.
					<br>
					Border:  The border can be employed to create a visual mark between elements.
					<br>
					Margin:  This will determine how close to rest next to other elements on the page.
